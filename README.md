# ROBOTC-Examples
Contains examples and guides on how to do things with NXT robots using ROBOTC.

## motors.c
Move the robot and use shooting motors

## sensors.c
Use the compass, ultrasonic, and gyroscope sensors.

**Note: Incomplete**. The gyroscope returns rate of tilting, not the actual tilt, so we need to integrate it to get useful information.

## joystick.c
Do stuff when buttons on a Logitech controller are pressed.

Note: the controller needs to be connected via USB to your computer.
